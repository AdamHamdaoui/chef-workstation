        chef target converge <TARGET> <RECIPE> [FLAGS]

      usage_full: |
        chef target converge <TARGET> <RESOURCE> <RESOURCE_NAME> [PROPERTIES] [FLAGS]

          Converge the specified <TARGET> with the single <RESOURCE>.
          [PROPERTIES] should be specified as key=value. For example:

            chef target converge myec2node directory /tmp/test mode="0777" action=create

        chef target converge <TARGET> <RECIPE> [FLAGS]

          Converge the specified <TARGET> with the single recipe located at
          <RECIPE>. For example:

            chef target converge myec2node path/to/cookbook/recipe.rb
            chef target converge myec2node path/to/cookbook
            chef target converge myec2node cookbook_name
            chef target converge myec2node cookbook_name::recipe_name

        ARGUMENTS:
          <TARGET>          The host or IP address to converge. Can also be an SSH or WinRM URL
                            in the form:

                            ssh://[USERNAME]@example.com[:PORT]
          <RESOURCE>        A Chef resource, such as 'user' or 'package'
          <RESOURCE_NAME>   The name, usually used to specify what 'thing' to set up with
                            the resource. For example, given resource 'user', 'name' would be
                            the name of the user you wanted to create.
          <RECIPE>          The recipe to converge. This can be provided as one of:
                            1. Full path to a recipe file
                            2. Cookbook name. First we check the working directory for this
                               cookbook, then we check in the chef repository path. If a
                               cookbook is found we run the default recipe.
                            3. This behaves similarly to 'cookbook name' above, but it also allows
                               you to specify which recipe to use from the cookbook.

          Use --ssl-no-verify when using SSL for WinRM and
          the remote host is using a self-signed certificate.
