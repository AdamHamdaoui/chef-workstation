            Converge the specified <TARGET> with the single <RESOURCE>. [ATTRIBUTES]
            should be specified as key=value. EG:

                            in the form:

          <RESOURCE_NAME>   The name, usually used to specify what 'thing' to set up with
                            the resource. For example, given resource 'user', 'name' would be
                            the name of the user you wanted to create.
