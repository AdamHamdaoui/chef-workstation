{{/* This shortcode is used for two purposes.
  1. Some shortcodes contain a code block with less than character "<". For some
  reason Hugo converts that to its html equivalent &lt; in the html output.

  2. Shortcodes that are indented because they're in a list don't display properly
  in the normal method that we use to add shortcodes, {{% shortcode_name %}}. Use
  this readFile shortcode to include those shortcodes instead.*/}}
