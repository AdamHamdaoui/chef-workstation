Foodcritic has been deprecated and will be removed from Chef Workstation
in the future. To encourage migration off this tool we have gated it behind
a feature flag. If the feature flag is disabled, foodcritic will output a
deprecation message and tell people how to enable the feature flag if they
want to use it. If the feature flag is enabled, foodcritic works as before.
